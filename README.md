#Prediction of fosforilation markers in breast cancer cellular lines

Use of both machine learning and deep learning methods for prediction of the fosforilation levels of the markers Akt, PLCg2, HER2, ERK, S6 
with crucial relevance in cancer prognosis and diagnosis.

Random Forest models were used for prediction of the fosforilation status. SHAP graphics were used for explicability test.

For the deep learning, unidimensional convolutional neuronal networks were used for prediction.
